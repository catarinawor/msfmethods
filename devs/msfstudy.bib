	abstract = {A model was developed to estimate ﬁshing-induced mortality and exploitation rates for unmarked salmon Oncorhynchus spp. in mark-selective ﬁsheries. This model is analogous to a pipeline, and the basic idea is similar to that of the change-in-ratio method used for estimating animal abundance. During spawning migration, a unidirectional movement occurs from the ocean to near shore and into freshwater. A series of nonselective and selective ﬁsheries consequently catch these ﬁsh on their migration path. The model functions as follows: First, a cohort analysis is completed for the coded-wire-tagged ﬁsh to obtain their initial abundance and ﬁshery-speciﬁc exploitation rate. Second, ﬁshery-speciﬁc exploitation rates of unmarked ﬁsh are derived. Third, the initial abundance of unmarked ﬁsh is obtained from the total exploitation rate and escapement and then the ratio between the abundances of unmarked and marked ﬁsh is estimated for each ﬁshery. Finally, the ﬁshery-speciﬁc mortality of unmarked ﬁsh is estimated. The method assumes that the release mortality rates in selective ﬁsheries are known. Methods for correcting potential bias are suggested. Sensitivity analyses show that the estimated exploitation rates of unmarked ﬁsh are less sensitive to bias in the release mortality rate than to bias in the estimated cohort size of marked ﬁsh. Bias in release mortality rates results in a diminishing bias of exploitation rates in sequential selective ﬁsheries, but bias in the estimated cohort size results in an increasing bias. An example is given for Sandy River coho salmon O. kisutch in the lower Columbia River. This method does not require double index tagging and can presumably be applied to most ﬁsheries. Some caveats in applying this model to salmon ﬁshery management are given.},

	abstract = {Mass marking of hatchery salmon and selective ﬁsheries on these marked ﬁsh are being implemented in the northeastern Paciﬁc Ocean. The potential impact of this management practice on current coded wire tag (CWT) programs has become a vital concern. Methods have been developed to maintain the viability of the current CWT programs by using double index tags (DITs). This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to examine uncertainty in estimating ﬁshing mortality of unmarked coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch based on the DIT method. Variables used in the simulation include marine survival rate, encounter rate, hook-and-release mortality rate, precision in catch and escapement sampling, and harvest rate in nonselective ﬁsheries. Results show that random variability in these variables creates signiﬁcant uncertainty in the estimates. Typically, the 90\% conﬁdence interval of the estimated ﬁshing mortality rate may take any value from below zero to more than double the true value. The precision of estimated ﬁshing impacts on unmarked salmon cannot be maintained at the level for marked salmon by using the DIT method.},
